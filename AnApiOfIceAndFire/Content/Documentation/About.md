## What is An Api Of Ice And Fire?


Descriptive text here


## Who are you?


I'm [Joakim Skoog](https://github.com/joakimskoog) and I build cool, cloud-based logistics software over at [Centiro](https://www.centiro.com/).

## Why did you build this?


I decided to build this API because I've always loved building stuff for other developers. I also love everything about the books in the A Song of Ice And Fire series and I follow all the different fan theories religiously.
I got inspired to build my own REST'ish API after finding Paul Hallett's awesome [SWAPI](http://swapi.co). 

Besides, this was a great opportunity to try out new techniques.

## Technology used


An Api of Ice And Fire is built with [ASP.NET Web API 2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn448365(v=vs.118).aspx) and [Entity Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx).
